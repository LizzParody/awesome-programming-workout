# American Dream Workout

Training hard to live the [American Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream).

## Training Log

You can create a `YOUR-NAME_training_log.csv` file to track the hours you spend traning to be a better programmer.  Study hours need to meet the following criteria:

* Must be timed
* Cell phone, Slack, and social media sites must be turned off
* The study period must be continuous and focused (e.g. no breaks to chat with coworkers)

Just like athletes need to train to achive their physical potential, coders should train to achieve their progmamming potential.  Runners have training programs [like this](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) to prepare for marathons.  Programmers should have similar training programs to level-up.

Training requires complete focus.  If you're training with a pull-up workout, focus will be less of an issue because the exercise is sufficiently difficult to command your full attention.  With programming, it is easy to get distracted from training by reading news, texting, or talking with coworkers.  Interrupted training doesn't count!

## Focus on the basics first
