# American Dream Workout

Training hard to live the [American Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream).

## How to deliberately practice

You can create a `YOUR-NAME_training_log.csv` file to track the hours you spend traning to be a better programmer.  Study hours need to meet the following criteria:

* Must be timed
* Cell phone, Slack, and social media sites must be turned off
* The study period must be continuous and focused (e.g. no breaks to chat with coworkers)

Just like athletes need to train to achive their physical potential, coders should train to achieve their progmamming potential.  Runners have training programs [like this](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) to prepare for marathons.  Programmers should have similar training programs to deliberately practice and continuously improve.

Training requires complete focus.  It's easier to completely focus on athletic training because the physical exertion commands your full attention.  When you're sitting in front of a computer, it is easy to get distracted from training by reading news, texting, or watching kitten videos.  We're becoming increasingly accustomed to living with constant distractions.  Read [this article on addiction to distractions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/addicted-to-distraction.html) and [this article on distraction junkie coders](http://www.componentowl.com/blog/zen-coder-vs-distraction-junkie/).

You'll need a lot of discipline to shut off all distractions and study, especially when starting out.  Start with 20 minutes and then progress to 30 minutes or an hour.

## Training log

The training log can only be updated with study hours that had a specific start time and were uninterrupted.  For example, if you start at 4:30, put a hour on a timer, and stop at 5:30, you can add an hour to the training log.

If you get interruped while training, you shouldn't count the study hour.  It just like how atletes cannot count two sets of 5 as a set of 10.  Interruptions / breaks matter and we need to fight against them in an increasingly distracting world.

## Focus on the basics first

If you aren't sure what to train, focus on a core technology like Bash, Git, or Vim.  You're bound to switch technology stacks throughout your career, but the core technologies usually stay the same.
