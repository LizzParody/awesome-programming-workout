# American Dream Workout

Training hard to get a job in the United States.

## Training Log

I'll be tracking my study hours in a CSV file to stay disciplined about my practice.  What gets measured gets improved.

## Study Approach

I'll focus on core technologies first and then work my way up the tech stack.  I'll start by mastering Bash, Vim, Git, and JavaScript and will work up to Scala, Spark, and beyond!
